# Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.<br>

### Arithmetic Operators
| Operator |	Name |	Description |	Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| +	| Addition	| 	Adds two operands |	x + y	|
| - | Subtraction	| Subtracts second operand from the first |	x - y	|
| *	| Multiplication	| Multiplies both operands	| x * y	|
| /	| Division	| Divides numerator by de-numerator	| x / y	|
| %	| Modulus	| Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division |	x % y	|
| ++ | Increment	| Increment operator increases integer value by one |	x++	|
| --	| Decrement	| Decrement operator decreases integer value by one |	x-- |

### Relational Operators

| Operator |	Description |	Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| == |	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.	| (A == B) is not true. |
| != |	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.	| (A != B) is true. |
| >	| Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	| (A > B) is not true. |
| <	| Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	| (A < B) is true. |
| >=	| Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	| (A >= B) is not true. |
| <=	| Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	| (A <= B) is true. |

### Logical Operators

Operator	Description	Example
&&	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true.	(A && B) is false.
||	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true.	(A || B) is true.
!	Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.	!(A && B) is true.
