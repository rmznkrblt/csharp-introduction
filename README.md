# csharp-introduction
This repository is a resource created both for myself and for beginners to the c # language. Since the topics interact with each other, I recommend that they be followed sequentially. This repository has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand basic C# programming. After the topics here are over, continue with the [OOP-csharp](https://github.com/rmznkrblt/OOP-csharp) repository, which is a more advanced level and will carry you forward in the sector. Good luck with!!!...
 
# What is c#?
 C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices.
 The most recent version is 9.0, which was released in 2020 in .NET 5.0 and included in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8. Mono is a free and open-source project to develop a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment (i.e. virtual machine) for the language.

C# is used for:
* Mobile applications
* Desktop applications
* Web applications
* Web services
* Web sites
* Games
* VR
* Database applications
* And much, much more!
 
 Following are some of the components of the c# âˆ’
 * [Garbage collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/)
 * [Exception handling](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/)
 * [Lambda expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions)
 * [Query syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/csharp/linq/)
 * [Asynchronous operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/)
 * [Pattern matching](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/csharp/pattern-matching)
 * [Unified type system](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/)
 
  All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type. All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types. C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.
